used to create valuable output. When people play the game they help determine the 
contents of images by providing meaningful labels for them. If the game is played 
as much as popular online games, we estimate that most images on the Web can be 
labeled in a few months. Having proper labels associated with each image on the Web would allow 
for more accurate image search, improve the accessibility of sites (by providing descriptions of 
images to visually impaired individuals), and help users block inappropriate images. 
Our system makes a significant contribution because of its valuable output and because 
of the way it addresses the image-labeling problem. Rather than using computer vision 
techniques, which don't work well enough, we encourage people to do the work by taking 
advantage of their desire to be entertained.},

However, the growth is not adequately supported by a framework with which to

systems to help identify parallels between different systems and reveal "holes" in 
the existing work as opportunities for new research. Since human computation is often 
confused with "crowdsourcing" and other terms, we explore the position of human computation
